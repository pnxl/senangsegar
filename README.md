# Senang Segar
Senang Segar is a pop-up stand selling smoothies, fruit sodas, and es campur. This group is formed for Dian Harapan's annual Entrepreneurship Day event - where groups of 6-7 people start a business and run it for three days.

This website serves as the menu page and to survey potential customers on price point and products.

While it isn't recommended to use this website for your own needs, it is definitely possible to do. You'll need a Supabase database alongside a web host for this website (can be static hosting, e.g. Cloudflare Pages, Vercel, etc.)

Refer to `.env.example` on how to setup. No other setup instructions will be provided.

Much love to Nuxt for a rock solid framework and Supabase for an easy-to-use database.  ‚ù§
